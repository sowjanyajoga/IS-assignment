### SYNOPSIS
The 3 files linked above were all intended to be part of the same study â€“ the investigators wanted to examine the day-night distribution of 2 species of zooplankton across multiple years. The type of zooplankton they studied is called rotifers generally, and specifically the genus Conochilus, in which groups of individual rotifers stick together in colonies. The investigators plan to repeat this study for several more years. 

### Task 1 Question
#1 Based on class readings, prior experience, and your own good sense, list some of the problems in the way that the data are currently organized (there are at least 8 problems with these spreadsheets; try to identify as many as possible, but at least 4).
**Response:** 
The problems identified from the data files provided are listed below:
1. Data is being maintained in two different files (zoop-temp.xlsx and zoop-temp-main.xlsx, which is not required as all the columns are same in both files.
2. In zoop-temp.xlsx it is stated that "_Station B is in a shallower southern arm of the lake, see yellow notebook for map and details_". But there is no yellow notebook or any link for this notebook provided.
3. The timings are not noted for the data, which will not allow the user to analyze the data by the criteria of the day and night distribution.
4. The data collected only consists of the date but not the time at which the data is collected. So this data does not help the investigators to examine the day-night distribution of the zooplankton species
4. The units of measurement for the columns in all the data files are not mentioned
5. The pond2010 data is for the year 2010, whereas the zoop data is for the year 2011. Linking both these data files and converting this to useful information would be a difficult task
7. Negative values were found in few columns like "number of cuni/chippo per litre" which are not valid values.
8. When the data is viewed through the column names, one cannot get an idea of the exact definition of the column as the column names are abbreviated. There is no definitions stated for all the column names
