### SYNOPSIS
This project is based on three unique data sets which are identified from different sources. A summary of the key details is provided

### Criteria of the Data Selection
* Extensive free text data; other qualitative and mixed data is fine if it’s at least nominal or
categorical, such as multiple choice answers

* Enormous data sets are burdensome for class projects; in most cases, you should select data
under 1 GB in volume, though there may be some exceptions.

* Data with restrictions that limit reuse and sharing

* Overly simplistic data: 2 columns is too trivial for grad school!

* Super complicated data: 20 tables would be a real pain to organize into usable files, but if
the data are truly awesome, it might be worth it.

* Data that contain personally-identifiable information (PII) such as full names, email addresses, contact details, etc. Exception: PII is OK when the persons are public figures, e.g.,
politicians, movie stars, etc. There may be other exceptions; ask if you’re not certain.

* Data about children or other clearly objectionable or morally questionable content (no R-rated
data, please).

##### The information regarding the data set provided includes the following details
1. The **name of the data set** as a header
2. About one **paragraph describing** why these data are interesting
3. A description of how much data there are, in what formats, etc. This should include how
many rows & columns (&/or tables) and sample column headers.
4. **Details of the license or terms of use** (_include a link if needed_)
5. **Potential data users** and **decision-makers** for this data
6. **Three questions this data might help to answer**; 
    >Note: Note additional data sources that would be needed, if applicable
7. An **APA-formatted data citation** (_including URL_)
