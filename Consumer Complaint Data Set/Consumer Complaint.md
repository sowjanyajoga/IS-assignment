**_Consumer Complaint Database_**

Financial products and services performance or reliability can be analyzed from this information

## Data Description
The data sets include the information of complaints received about financial products and services.
The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints on a range of consumer financial products and services, sent to companies for response. 
Verification of all the facts alleged in these complaints, but steps will be taken to confirm a commercial relationship between the consumer and the company. 

Since we started accepting complaints in July 2011, we’ve helped consumers connect with financial companies to understand issues with their mortgages, fix errors on their credit reports, stop harassment from debt collectors, and get direct responses about problems with their credit cards, checking and savings accounts, student loans, and more. We analyze the data to identify trends and problems in the marketplace to help us do a better job supervising companies, enforcing federal consumer financial laws and writing rules and regulations. We publish reports on complaints and share information with state and federal agencies.

The database generally updates daily, and contains certain information for each complaint, including the source of the complaint, the date of submission, and the company the complaint 
was sent to for response. The database also includes information about the actions taken by the company in response to the complaint, such as, whether the company’s response was 
timely and how the company responded. If the consumer opts to share it and after we take steps to remove personal information, we publish the consumer’s description of what happened. 
Companies also have the option to select a public response. Company level information should be considered in context of company size and/or market share. 
Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.  

Ways we can use complaint data:  

We can forward each complaint to the appropriate company for a response.
We can share complaint data with state and federal agencies. We also present reports to Congress. 
We analyze complaint data to help with our work to supervise companies, enforce federal consumer financial laws, and write better rules and regulations.
We publish complaints in the Consumer Complaint Database (without information that directly identifies you).
